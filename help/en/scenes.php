			<h4>Definition of a scene</h4>

				<p>
					A <b>scene</b> is characterized by a place (set), and an action. It must not be confused with a sequence (which is only
					a succession of shots), or with a shot (which is the result of a camera filming the scene).
				</p>
				In a scene, there is:
				<ul>
					<li>some <b>assets</b>, defining characters, set, props, etc.</li>
					<li><b>animations</b> that will define action, filmed by cameras.</li>
					<li>several <b>cameras</b>. Each camera is associated to a shot, into a sequence.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					There are two types of scenes: <b>MASTER</b> scenes, and <b>CHILD</b> scenes (also called <b>"DERIVATIVES"</b>).<br />
					"Master" scenes are the base entity of scenes, i.e. the groupment of assets, place and action. They generally don't include
					cameras. "Child" scenes are some <b>instanciated copies</b> of the master scene, i.e. they include the same assets (characters,
					set, action, etc.) than their master scene, but a child scene also include the cameras filming the scene. A child scene can also <b>exclude
					some assets</b> which are not necessary to a shot (if they are out of frame, for example).
				</p>
				<p>
					Generally, we <b>first build a master scene</b>, to define an entire action into a set (matching film's synopsis). Then we
					<b>derivate this scene</b> into several child scenes ("derivatives"), according to the <b>storyboard</b>, in order to add cameras,
					which will be associated to shots in film's sequences.
				</p>
				<p>
					This method allows to <b>add assets later</b> in master scenes, without having to add them also in child scenes, because they
					depends on their master scene, and therefore have the same assets by default. This is very useful, especially if there are a
					lot of derivatives of the master scene. Moreover, the benefit is that cameras inside child scenes can be <b>animated independantly</b>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Scenes management is done into the "Scenes" section (drop-down menu at the top left of the project window).

			<h4>Scenes departments</h4>

				These departments are only present when they have been choosen in the project's configuration.
				It's possible to rename, and add some departments in tools panel, button "SaAM admin" (for users with access granted on this tool).<br />
