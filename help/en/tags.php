				<p>
					Tags are very useful to mark some shots, in order to make very precise listings, and sort or choose some shots among the many
					shot that a project can contain.<br />
					They also allow to export lists of shots in PDF, XML or TXT.
				</p>
				Two types of tags exist:
				<ul>
					<li><b>GLOBALS</b> tags</li>
					<li><b>USER</b> tags</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					"Globals" tags are defined by SaAM's admin. They are accessible in every projects, and visible by everybody.
				</p>
				<p>
					"User" tags are also usable in all projects, but they are owned by the user who created them.
					Only the creator of a user tag has access to it. However he can share a tag with somebody else, to create common lists to work with.
